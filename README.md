smarthome
===========

API for controlling devices in the house via vera.

Currently working for:
* Lights
* Locks
* Nest (climate)
* Belkin Wemo

Hardcoded to work for my house but will include plans to expose this in future.

Thanks @bencxr for the guidance -- I must disclaim that the bad style is my fault :/ lololol
